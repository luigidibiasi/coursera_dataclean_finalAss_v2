# coursera_dataclean_finalAss_v2


This is a project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.
The goal is to produce clean, tidy data saved in a text file named "FinalData.txt", utilizing various functions and methods covered throughout the course.

The following zip file contains the data:

We execute the following procedures to obtain a clean dataset after obtaining the data and generating a file (if one does not already exist):
Creating a single data set by combining the training and test sets.

You have to use To dplyr to reproduce the experimentation.

Just the measurements on the mean and standard deviation are extracted for each measurement.
We used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data collection.
Labelling the data collection with descriptive variable names that are appropriate.
Create a second, independent clean data set (FinalData.txt) with the average of each variable for each activity and subject from the data set created in step 4.
The run_analysis is a program that analyzes data.
